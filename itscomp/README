[29 December 2009]

Well, this code appears to kinda-sorta work, but big samples fail since I
haven't quite nailed how to handle more than one data block. Not that it's
at all easy to test, considering that the algorithm I'm using is laughably
inefficient (on the order of taking a couple seconds per sample).

In addition, compression is not quite optimal yet, though very simple cases
all seem to be handled accurately. BUT! it functions at least for small data,
so that's a step farther than anyone else has gotten, so I'm satisfied.

I don't intend to pursue this further, inasmuch as it was kind of fun to do,
since it is not very useful. There's really no justification for such an
algorithm -- zlib and bzip2 both tend to produce better results (see itz.py),
and they're certainly more widely available. Tests with a few randomly chosen
samples shows that bzip2 compression of delta-encoded sample data gives very
good results in general.
