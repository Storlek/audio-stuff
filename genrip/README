usage: genrip *.vgm

This strips through each .vgm file given, finds and extracts sample data,
and dumps out a corresponding .it file for use as a sample library.

It's "close" -- perhaps even mildly useful -- but it's still a total hack.
Just opening the file in a sample editor and slicing it into pieces might
produce better results.
