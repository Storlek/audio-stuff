gym2it - Storlek - http://rigelseven.com/

how to use in three steps:
1) $ make && ./gym2it this.gym that.it
2) open tracker
3) rewrite everything and overwrite gym2it's terrible output :)

I don't foresee putting more effort into this, but if you are
motivated/crazy enough to develop it further, go right ahead.
You can send patches to storlek@rigelseven.com if so inclined.
